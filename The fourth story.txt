"How to speak Russian, polite Englishman everywhere late. 
Time. It is so appreciated in our time, that we would gladly spend all their money by making faster, if only we had the time to do even more things. 
Ten or more years ago, if you suddenly wanted very much to see the video with a falling cat, you would be gone a minute to download movies from the Internet. Spend this moment could not afford one of us. So we came up with watching videos directly online. Fortunately, a group of manufacturers of mobile phones around the world paid to the UK government 22 billion pounds for something called 3G. Now people have to wait for the video clip with falling cat only five seconds, and for a while we were all happy. 
The same thing we are seeing in the elevators. We need a button that closes the door when we are ready to go. And behind the wheel - we resent in traffic and helmet curse when someone walks slowly down the sidewalk. 

And it's weird because we British are still willing to spend hours every day on the antics and chatter with people you do not know. Our obsession with good manners means that we feel a duty to discuss the weather with the postman and leave with a hairdresser. We write to laugh long letters of thanks to people who have already thanked verbally. In business correspondence, we use phrases that do not actually need - just a need to be polite. And if we want guidance, I always start like this: "I'm sorry. I'm afraid I seem intrusive, but ... »

Cease all this because recently spent a week in Russia - a country where, it seems, did not invent manners. When the receptionist at the hotel desk asks for your passport, she said, "Could you show your passport for a moment, sir, if you are not severely hamper?". She says: "Passport". And if you can not find it for three seconds, then adds: "Rather!». 

If you ordered a dish, which is currently not on the menu, there will be no long awkward explanation from the waiter. He simply says, "It does not have." And if you try to drag your luggage through the revolving door, no one will wait patiently until you solve the problem. Will continually push the door until the bag you will not beat all, and all the fingers will not be beaten. 

When the British-Top Gear fan wants to take a picture with me, he watches explains how his son watch the show on the channel «Dave», and how he can parody me, and how everyone in the house "pray" for our program. In Russia, just say: "Photo". And if they do not have a camera with you, you said to stand and wait until they go home and do not take it. 

Ever stood behind two Brits in the queue for a ski lift? 
- After you. 
- No, you were the first. 
- Nay, I am sure you were the first. 
- Oh, all right. I do not mind waiting. What a beautiful day. 
- Much warmer than last year. 

Stand in line in Russia is much easier - because no one cares. Just go to the top of the queue, and if someone objects - and exactly what happened - pull out your wallet and show your credit card was indignant. In Russian, it means "I am richer than you, the sun, so shut up». 

Same story with the so-called polite discussions. Russian do not support counter-arguments subtle hints, and simply say, "You're wrong." That was the conversation I had: 
- World is ruled by Jews. 
- I understand what you're saying, but I think that's not the reason. 
- You are wrong. 
- But there are many examples ... 
- I said, you're wrong. 

For the British is all very weird. But some time later I began to realize that incivility saves a lot of time and you do not need anything. When someone is spending your evening on every rattle nonsense, just say that they are wrong and walk away. In a butcher shop does not bother a small conversation. Just say "two patties" and wait until you are told the price. When someone drags down the sidewalk, push it off the road. The bar did not try to catch sight bartender. Just shout out your order from the end of the queue. 
This certainly works in "Aeroflot". Plane begins to rise, although not all were seated, and on landing you do not rub nonsense about the weather and the pilot does not wish to further successful trip. You are told to sit up straight and remain in place until the plane stops. But nobody listens. 

Already at home, at the airport "Heathrow", I came across quite sociable immigration officer. "How long were driving?" - He asked politely. I saved two seconds, not bothering to answer. 
Terrible themselves felt. Guilty to terror. But precisely this is the curse to be British. That is why we need the 4G button and closing elevator doors, and even high-speed trains. Because they save us more time so we can write long letters of thanks and a little chat with the milkman.
